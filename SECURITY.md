## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.
If a vulnerability is found in the software then report it in issues and submit a pull request for the vulnerability and then i will review the request
Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.
When an issue and pull request have been submited you should go to the projects pull request page for an update and you can expect an update in two to one weeks depending on the vulnerability
and you should expect and email form me if the vulnerablity is aceppted and the amount of time it might take me to roll out an update
if you do not recive an email from me within two weeks then that means the the pull request and vulnerability has not been accepted i will ususally send an email on why i wasnt accepted 
also if i have accpeted it but you havent recieved an email form me then that means i am working on the issue but if not i will send an email explaining why it was accepted and if the vulnerability could not be fixed
but if the vulnrability is declined i will send an email why it was declined.
